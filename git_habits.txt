Here are the git habits that I should develop:

git init

-source code, text file, that will change over time
-source code, text file, that you might make publicly available

git add

git commit

git branch


git push


-Did I change a set : git commit
-making changes, but not sure if you'll keep them:      git branch
-making changes, but wanna keep a working copy:         git branch

-git push
