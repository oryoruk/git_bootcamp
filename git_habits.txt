Here are the git habits that I want to instill:
(simple if/else decisions, so that I don't have to decide on the fly)

CREATE A GIT REPO: git init
________________________________________

-if source code, text file
    -that is likely to change over time
    -that you might want to make publicly available at some point (publication, presentation, meetings, on the website, etc.)
    -that is part of a collaborative effort
    -that you are working on on different machines
-else:
    -files that will remain the same no matter what
    -binary files: word, 




ADD FILE TO REPO: git add FILE_NAME
________________________________________

-if file is an evolving, text based part of the repo (initial add, to track)
-if file has been updated in this sitting



COMMIT CHANGES TO REPO: git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
________________________________________

-if a set of interrelated, connected updates have been made



CREATE A BRANCH: git branch branch_name
________________________________________

-if about to make changes, but not sure if you'll keep them
-if about to make changes, but wanna keep a working copy just in case


PUSH COMMITS TO ORIGIN: git push
________________________________________

-if it has been a while
-if you will continue working on it on a different machine
-if in collaboration
